I, along with three of my classmates, founded a new publication to highlight the diverse voices of the RCA Design Products course. Titled 2MD, or Too Many Designers, the publication is a curated collection of articles, pictures and thoughts. Within this collaborative team, I took the lead on writing the Editorâ€™s Letters as well as editing the content of the zine. I also contributed a piece of my own for each of the editions.

Two editions were released during our founding year and can be accessed at https://2md.netlify.app/
