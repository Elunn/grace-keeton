Grace Keeton is a product designer from Cincinnati, Ohio. She studied Mechanical Engineering at The Ohio State University before completing her Masters in Design Products at the Royal College of Art. 

Her STEM-centric family, colorful Latino heritage, and innate curiosity and tenacity have driven to develop both sides of her brain. 

She is an avid researcher, enjoying the process of delving deeper into topics to discover connecting threads to a greater story. Her years of theater training helped her develop this story-telling ability, allowing her to successfully frame both projects and proposals. Her technical foundation in engineering trained her to problem solve and think critically, fueling her passion for user-centered design.

# Manifesto

I strive to design things that comment on the human condition (I.e. what makes people unique vs connected, human vs inhuman).

I feel passionately about designing to help either ignite or process emotions.

I believe in being emotionally connected and invested in my work.

I design things with theoretical depth.

Designing for one person can be just as valuable as designing for a thousand.

I am inspired by design that taps into humanâ€™s humility and vulnerability (both as an audience and as a subject).
